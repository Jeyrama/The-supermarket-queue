/*
There is a queue for the self-checkout tills at the supermarket. 
Your task is write a function to calculate the total time required for all the customers to check out!

input:
  customers: an array of positive integers representing the queue. 
  Each integer represents a customer, and its value is the amount of time they require to check out.
  n: a positive integer, the number of checkout tills.

output:
  The function should return an integer, the total time required.

Examples:
  queueTime([5,3,4], 1)
  // should return 12
  // because when there is 1 till, the total time is just the sum of the times

  queueTime([10,2,3,3], 2)
  // should return 10
  // because here n=2 and the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th people in the 
  // queue finish before the 1st person has finished.

  queueTime([2,3,10], 2)
  // should return 12

Clarifications:
  There is only ONE queue serving many tills, and
  The order of the queue NEVER changes, and
  The front person in the queue (i.e. the first element in the array/list) proceeds to a till as soon as it becomes free.
*/


// Solution

function queueTime(customers, registers) {
  let arr = [];

  for(let i = 0; i < registers; i++)
    arr[i] = 0;

  for(let i = 0; i < customers.length; i++) {
    arr[0] += customers[i];
    arr.sort((a, b) => a - b);
  }

  return arr[arr.length - 1];
}

// or

function queueTime(customers, n) {

  // Make an array containing n amount of elements, 
  // n representing the number of tills, 
  // and fill with zeroes
  let tills = new Array(n).fill(0);

  // Iterate through the customers 
  for (let time of customers) {

    // Find the till that has the least time
    let idx = tills.indexOf(Math.min(...tills));

    // Add the time, representing the customer to
    // the till that has the least time
    tills[idx] += time;
  }

  // Return the till that has the longest wait time
  // This is the required time to get all customers
  // through the que.
  return Math.max(...tills);
}
